/* here we will learn about variables and comments

 first of lets talk about low level and high level 

 so low level is related or close to hardware but high level is not related to hardware and its far from it.

 low level is something 0's and 1's  and high level is something that sounds logical

 so variables are containers to store data */

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int urja = 9;
    int ron = 10;
    cout<< urja + ron;
    return 0;
